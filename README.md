# Portfolio

Nothing really interesting on this repository. For the record, I'm working on a new version of my [personal portfolio](http://www.brendanabolivier.com), from scratch, I only re-use the content. Here's the source code in case you'd like to check it out.

Most of the features have been hand-made (well, based on [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), but you get it), and I tried my best to comment the code as I could.

## Preview and branches

**master** contains the new version I'm working on. Still incomplete, but eh. You can preview it live (kind of, I try to remember to pull there at each change) on [http://new.brendanabolivier.com](http://new.brendanabolivier.com).

**old** contains the old (but still current) portfolio. For now, you can still check it out on [http://www.brendanabolivier.com](http://www.brendanabolivier.com).
