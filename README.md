# Portfolio

Nothing really interesting on this repository. For the record, I'm working on a new version of my [personal portfolio](http://www.brendanabolivier.com), from scratch, I only re-use the content. Here's the source code in case you'd like to check it out.

Most of the features have been hand-made (well, based on [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), but you get it), and I tried my best to comment the code as I could.
